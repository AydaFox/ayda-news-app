# Ayda News App

## Link to the app

Explore the [Ayda News App](https://ayda-news-app.netlify.app/) for yourself!

## Description

This is my front-end project to create a working app that allows users to view and interact with news articles, similar in functionality to how sites like Reddit work.

On this app you wil be able to:
1. Browse a list of news articles
2. Filter articles by topic
3. Sort the articles by date, comments and votes in descending/ascending order
4. Click on an article to view it and the comments users have left
5. Upvote or downvote articles and comments
6. Comment on an article as a hardcoded user, and delete that user's comments 

## Back-end Repo

My project to develop the API used for this app can be found [here](https://github.com/AydaFox/ayda-news-server).

## How to Setup and Run Locally

Follow these steps in your terminal:

1. Clone the GitHub repo
   - `git clone https://github.com/AydaFox/ayda-news-app.git`
2. Install all dependencies required for the project to run
   - `npm install`
3. Run the app locally
   - `npm run dev`
4. Ctrl + click on the provided URL in the terminal, it will look like: `http://localhost:<port_number>`
   - This will open the app in your default browser

Please ensure you have installed:
- node v16 or later

Have fun!
